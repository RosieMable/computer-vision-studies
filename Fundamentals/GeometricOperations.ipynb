    "\n",
    "Geometric transformations change the coordinates of an image, affecting its appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Image Representation\n",
    "Images are treated as functions of coordinates (x, y).\n",
    "Integer points are sampled (e.g., (0,0), (1,1)).\n",

    "## Affine Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "A subset of geometric transformations that includes:\n",

    "### Scaling\n",
    "Reshaping the image (shrinking or expanding).\n",
    "Scaling factors can be applied to both x and y axes.\n",
    "Example: Scaling by a factor of 2 stretches \n",
    "the image.\n",
    "**Interpolation** is a method used to determine unknown pixel values based on neighboring pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translation\n",
    "Shifting the image horizontally or vertically.\n",
    "Achieved by adding pixel values (tx for horizontal, ty for vertical).\n",

    "### Rotation\n",
    "Rotating the image by a specified angle (Î¸).\n",
    "Uses a rotation matrix for counter-clockwise rotation."
