    "# Image Processing Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spatial Operations\n",
    "- **Definition**: Spatial operations involve manipulating the pixels of an image directly based on their spatial relationships.\n",
    "- **Applications**: Used for tasks like blurring, sharpening, and edge detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolution\n",
    "- **What it is**: A mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third function. In image processing, it involves applying a filter (kernel) to an image.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - A kernel (small matrix) is defined, which is moved across the image.\n",
    "  - At each position, the kernel values are multiplied by the corresponding pixel values, and the results are summed to produce a new pixel value.\n",
    "- **Example**: A common kernel for blurring is:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  kernel = [[1/9, 1/9, 1/9],\n",
    "            [1/9, 1/9, 1/9],\n",
    "            [1/9, 1/9, 1/9]]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To identify the boundaries within images where there is a significant change in intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques:\n",
    "**Sobel Operator**: A popular method that uses two 3x3 kernels to detect edges in horizontal and vertical directions.\n",
    "**Canny Edge Detection**: A multi-stage algorithm that detects a wide range of edges in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Median Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function**: A non-linear filter that replaces each pixel's value with the median value of the intensities in its neighborhood.\n",
    "**Benefits**: Effective in removing 'salt and pepper' noise while preserving edges better than linear filters.\n",
    "Example: In a 3x3 neighborhood, the median is calculated and replaces the center pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Image Sharpening\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: To enhance the clarity of an image by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques\n",
    "**Unsharp Masking**: Involves subtracting a blurred version of the image from the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Laplacian Filter**: A second derivative filter that highlights regions of rapid intensity change."
